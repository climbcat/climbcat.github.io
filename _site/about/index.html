    <p>Programming is the thing that I am technically most skilled at.</p>

<p>The low-level mindset does not necessitate “religious” application in every project. Having written plenty of stuff 
in Python, C# etc., and used OOP for years, I would say that there is a time and place for a lot of it.
Especially given important constraints such as team skills, the nature of users, time and performance requirements.</p>

<p>This site itself uses a markdown-based static html/website generator called Jekyll - which is convenient for someone who isn’t
focused on “web stuff”.</p>

<p>I wrote my first programs in high school, and picked it up later in my studies in physics, which culminated in a simulation of magnetic dynamics
in nanoparticles, the core of my masters thesis from 2008. For a while I saw programming as just a tool, but realized
that it came very naturally to me. So I left academia and got my first job as a professional software developer the same year.</p>

<p>Programmers should ideally struggle with the hard fundamentals of writing larger projects, and be able to secure code maintainability and 
extensibility over its lifetime, keeping complexity managable. Yet very often, projects tend to grow towards inevitable abandonment or
petrification due to complexity. They rarely shrink at all. Many projects becomes so utterly convoluted that changing normal things seems
overwealming, slow and risky.</p>

<p>The “low-level” programming method is to write the initial code quickly, paying no mind to advanced methodologies. Then “compress” it afterwards 
by re-writing, extracting commonalities, and creating convenient after-the-fact abstractions. Bearing little mind to pre-conceived forms
and shapes, this technique interestingly applies to all levels of code “abstraction”. It is a proper way to write.</p>

<p>Custom code is best, if you can get it: The advantage are control and focus, as well as efficiency and potentially, performance.
Always seek to minimize code size and dependencies.</p>

<p>A point mentioned less than often, is that writing and integrating our own code is a self-accellerating process that builds
programming skills. Now it becomes (much) easier to write the next batch.</p>
